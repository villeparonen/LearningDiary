# Peer to peer learning-diary 

Fullstack web-app developed in a group (with Ville Paronen, Mari Väänänen and Jukka Alkunen) and as a part of Academy JavaScript intensive training. Technologies used: ExpressJS, NodeJS, REST api, JQuery, HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap.

In the app, you can write down your learning progress in a given day/time, see your own posts and modify or delete them. You can also see posts other people have written.
